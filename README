This repository contains inputs used to create runoff mapping files from
glc to ocn.

Suggested use: copy (or sym link) the relevant files to the
cime/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files/runoff_to_ocn directory, then run
the desired make_mapping_files_* script(s) from there. (I think the
mapping tools have some assumptions that you're running the commands
from that directory.)
